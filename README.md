# AntibioticResistanceSim
The bacterial dataset includes:
- Bacteria: The bacterial species.
- Antibiotic: The antibiotic used against the bacterium.
- Resistance_Mechanism: How the bacterium resists the antibiotic.
- Susceptible_Death_Rate: Mortality rate of susceptible strains (hypothetical values for simulation purposes).
- Resistant_Death_Rate: Mortality rate of resistant strains (hypothetical values for simulation purposes).
- Mutation_Rate: Rate at which susceptible strains develop resistance (hypothetical values for simulation purposes).
